# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
During 2023 I undertook a government funded Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering (fundamentals) with HyperionDev and I am looking for my first junior/trainee tech role.

During my bootcamp I have been learning about all things Python, creating small programs and capstone projects with variables and booleans, if/elif/else blocks, for and while loops, lists and dictionaries, file I/O, functions and class objects.

During workshops I have also learnt some basics on SQL and SQLite, HTML, CSS and Javascript, GIT and GitHub.
