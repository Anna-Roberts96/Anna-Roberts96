# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
During 2023 I undertook a short Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering (fundamentals) with HyperionDev.

During my bootcamp I used Python to create small programs and capstone projects with variables and booleans, if/elif/else blocks, for and while loops, lists and dictionaries, file I/O, functions and class objects. During workshops I have also learnt some basics on SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript and GIT.
