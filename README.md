# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I'm soon to finish my bootcamp with HyperionDev on Software Engineering (fundamentals) and I am looking for my first junior/trainee tech role.

During my bootcamp I have been learning about all things Python, creating small programs with variables and booleans, if/elif/else blocks, for and while loops, lists and dictionaries, file I/O, functions and class objects. I have also gotten quite good at looking up code errors.

During workshops I have also learnt some basics on SQL and SQLite, HTML, CSS and Javascript, GIT and GitHub (as you can see)
